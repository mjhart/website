title: About Me
---

My name is Matt Hart. I'm a software engineer living in Brooklyn, NY. In the past I have worked at Two Sigma, Google, and Microsoft. I'm currently taking some time off to figure out what I want out of my next job. I'm also working on [SpireUI](https://spireui.com), a no-code tool for backend API developers to easily build web apps.

I enjoy thinking about alternative programming paradigms - especially ways to make programming more accessible to people without formal training. Outside of software, I like playing/watching soccer, boardgames, skiing, and seeing live music.
